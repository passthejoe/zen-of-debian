## The daily update

Western culture tells us that repetition is bad.

Repetition is mindless, we are told.

Yet we are told mastery is good. But it's better when that mastery is the result of pure genius and not relentless, repetitious toil.

But even geniuses need to practice. 

When I saw violinist Joshua Bell lead the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields as both conducter and concertmaster, playing the violin with speed, fluidity and ease, it looks like the most natural thing in the world.

Yet he didn't get there without many thousands of hours of practice and performance over decades.

Without repetition, Joshua Bell the virtuoso could never happen.

I don't want to compare mastering the violin with washing dishes, sweeping the floor, and setting up and maintaining a Linux system.

But I do. And I will.

Running `sudo apt update` won't get you to Carnegie Hall (except maybe to the venue's IT department).

My old laptop still runs Fedora. When things are working, I tend to stick with it. In Fedora, there are updates just about every day. Sometimes I don't open it for a month at a time. When I wait that long, there are hundreds of packages ready to upgrade and up to a gigabyte of data that Fedora's package-manager, `dnf`, needs to pull down.

I expect that the pace of package upgrades is almost the same

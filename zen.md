Installing, managing and using the Debian GNU/Linux operating system on your computers can bring a sense of calm, mastery and productivity to your life and work.

If Debian Stable works on your computer today, it will keep working for the rest of the two-year release window, plus an additional year, with minimal yet important updates that will keep your system secure.

Like most Linux operating systems — called *distributions* — Debian comes with all the tools you'll need to install and remove software using remote repositories that contain tens of thousands of packages. Those same tools will keep Debian up to date with the latest security patches and critical bug fixes.

Also with those tools, you have the power and the option to upgrade your *Stable* system to the *Testing* or Unstable* releases, or the *next* Stable release when Debian's developers deem it ready.

Whether you are a full-fledged Debian Developer, or a new user installing Debian for the first time, you are part of a history and tradition that goes back to the beginning of the Linux kernel in the 1990s, the GNU tools in the 1980s, and the first Multics and Unix operating systems of the 1960s and 1970s.

Installing, managing and using the Debian GNU/Linux operating system on your computers can bring a sense of calm, mastery and productivity to your life and work.

If Debian Stable works on your computer today, it will keep working for the rest of the two-year release window, plus an additional year, with minimal yet important updates that will keep your system secure.

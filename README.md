# The Zen of Debian

"The Zen of Debian" is a book about the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. It's also a personal book about my computing journey and how an operating system like Debian — or really any Linux- or BSD-based OS — can bring order, calm, productivity and stability to your life and work.

Right now, I'm planning to write and edit the book with git and on GitHub.

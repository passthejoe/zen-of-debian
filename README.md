# The Zen of Debian

"The Zen of Debian" is a book about the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. It's also a personal book about my computing journey and how an operating system like Debian — or really any Linux- or BSD-based OS — can bring order, calm, productivity and stability to your life and work.

Right now, I'm planning to write and edit the book with git and on GitHub.

## Who am I?

My name is [Steven Rosenberg](http://passthejoe.net). I am a journalist, writer and developer. I have written quite a bit about my experiences with computer hardware and software from the perspective of an inquiring user learning things along the way.

Like many who have been blogging over the years, I have posts in various systems that I'd like to bring under my own control. I began using Linux and BSD operating systems around 2007 when I didn't have a computer of my own and was hacking on old machines that included a surplus thin client and cast-off laptops. 

In more recent years — 2012 and 2017 — I have used Windows on new laptops in order to give the OS "a chance" and avoid compatibility issues that can affect new hardware. I gave Windows 10 maybe two years on my current HP Envy laptop before giving up after some very thorny upgrades and enough quirks to make me question why I didn't just return to an OS where simplicity, stability and performance are all part of the package (and package management system).

For me over the years, those OSes have been the Debian and Fedora distributions of Linux. I first used Debian in the 4.0 "Etch" era, and was surprise to find out it was a bluer, faster yet not appreciably more difficult version of what the brown yet growing Ubuntu was offering in the 6.06 era. I experimented rather heavily with both Debian and Ubuntu at the time, and I seemed to always come back to Debian.

I looked back at the [list of Debian releases](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) and realize that I've spent time using every one from Etch (Version 4) through the current stable release Buster (Version 10).

I have run _a lot_ of [Fedora over the years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_version_history). I began 2010 with version 13 and stuck with Fedora through version 15, turning to Debian Squeeze when a Fedora upgrade went really bad due to the proprietary AMD/Catalyst video driver. I returned to Fedora with my next laptop in 2012 — the Fedora 17 "Beefy Miracle" era. I still have that laptop today, and it runs Fedora 30, I had ONE bad upgrade in all those years, and that time I was able to reinstall Fedora and use the same partitions and `/home` directory.  

With my current laptop, a 2017 HP Envy, I decided to spend some time using Windows 10, and it was a couple of years before thorny upgrades, persistent bugs and lagging performance led me to get a small, cheap M.2 NVMe SSD, and install Debian Stable (version 10 Buster). I immediately began to feel comfortable and productive on the computer I use for wrangling websites, writing and editing, hacking on Ruby, and all of the other day-to-day things I do with a PC.
